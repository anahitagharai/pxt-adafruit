**Important**
make sure the [Code](/projects/staff/code) portion of this project is done before making the staff!

## Step 1: Spray Painting

Spray paint the wooden rod, cube, and sphere dark brown. Wait approximately 30 minutes for it to dry and resume the rest of the project while waiting.

## Step 2: Making the Diamond 


Cut a 2 inch piece off the balsa wood. Cut 3 more so you have 4 pieces total, all equal in length.

 Hot glue the sides together so that it makes a square. This will be the base of your diamond.

 Next, cut a 4 inch piece off the balsa wood. Cut 3 more so you have 4 pieces total. 
 Place the pieces on each corner, perpendicular to the square. You want the pieces to make a triangular shape, so make them all point towards the center. Hot glue all the pieces together in the center, then line up the pieces with the corners of the square and hot glue there as well.

 Cut a 2 inch piece off the balsa wood. Cut 3 more so you have 4 pieces total. Insert them into the foam cube until the sticks are stable. Then, tape the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express onto the middle of the cube.

Last in this step, hot glue the pieces sticking out of the wood to the corners of the square. Your diamond is now complete! 

## Step 3: Putting the Pieces Together

After the sphere and rod have dried, hot glue the sphere onto one end of the rod. Then, hot glue the cube with the diamond onto the sphere.

 ## Step 4: Tissue Paper

 Cut triangles and rectangles out of the white tissue paper that line up exactly with all the sides of the diamond. Cut a small hole in one of the rectangular pieces and put the wire through the hole. Connect the battery pack to the Adafruit.

 Begin hot gluing the perimeter of the diamond and start placing your tissue paper shapes onto the wood.
